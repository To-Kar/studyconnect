# Exercise 11.3 — Relevant UX Factors for StudyConnect

| UX Factor | a) Importance for StudyConnect Users | b) How Design/Features Support It | c) Risks if Ignored |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Efficiency** | Students manage numerous tasks; quick, simple interactions reduce effort. | Streamlined task creation, shortcuts, one-tap overview of deadlines. | Cognitive overload and frustration; abandonment for snappier tools. |

| **Stimulation** | Sustains study motivation via playful and social cues. | Gamified progress, badges, group goals, supportive messages. | App feels cold or utilitarian; engagement declines mid-term. |
| **Attractiveness** | Emotional appeal enhances retention and attachment. | Modern, readable UI, color consistency, responsive design for all devices. | Users perceive the product as outdated or uninspiring. |
| **Novelty** | Differentiates StudyConnect and stimulates curiosity. | New visualization (e.g., modular goal timeline) and contextual AI suggestions. | Product seen as undistinctive; innovation overshadowed by competitors
