# 7.1  
As we develop a sort of a social media platform we decided to mainly use the "Use Case" test design technique. The use cases were described in Assignment 2.  
Everything the application needs is written down in a use case. So if all use cases are tested, the whole application is tested. Problem in our particular  
case is, that we did not implement all use cases.
