## 3. Requirements Recap

### 3.1 Initial Requirements

**Functional requirements:**
- user management (register/login, profiles, join/leave groups, admin invites/
    removals, role-based permissions)
-task/goal management (CRUD with title/notes/priority/due date/category, states
    open/in progress/completed, list/filter/sort, export to PDF/ICS)
- group collaboration (create groups, assign tasks, task comments/messages, 
    members update progress, group-wide overview) 
- deadline awareness (show upcoming/overdue, highlight urgency, reminders/
    notifications, visualize progress)
- motivation/gamification (points/badges, achievement view, non-intrusive)
- accessibility/integration (web app across devices, data sync, exports, 
    modular extensions).

**Quality requirements:**
- usability (intuitive, quick task creation)
- functional suitability (complete/correct functions)
- reliability (stable, no data loss, recoverable sessions)
- portability (works across environments, exports/integrations)
- testability (modular, role separation, finite task states).
